8/19/2020 - Initial Commits
6:07 P.M. Created unique branch for contributions to assigned metrics
6:30 P.M. Imported CSV files; Deciding what data to use

8/20/2020 - Beginning T-Tests
12:10 P.M. Reviewing lessons on Hypothesis Testing
02:00 P.M. Tech Talk Seminar. Not related, just a break notation.
03:39 P.M. Totally changing directions -- I originally wanted to do a scatterplot and a bar chart showing the individual metrics but now I'm thinking of doing two gmap charts to show the concentration of the US population, and the avg. emissions for 2018 to match my census data.
04:12 P.M. Fixing gitignore files. API keys were visible.
04:29 P.M. Back on track
04:33 P.M. After importing my first heatmap for 2018's population, I realized the data available for emissions did not include 2018
05:05 P.M. Realizing a heatmap for population would also look silly because I only have capital cities lat/lng and mapping a single city wouldn't be good for documenting the metrics for my hypothesis. Back to the drawing board. Dinner break.
06:00 P.M. Office Hours - Fixed git questions 
09:54 P.M. Class Log -- We settled on using five states to plot emissions data for all of the information we are going to present. I am going to go ahead and play around with the data and determine whether all fifty states would be a better trend to document the metrics. If it is I'll make a scatterplot and try to figure out how to differentiate markers by state so we can see where everyone is on their emissions. If I choose to limit it to the five states we narrowed it down to, I will use a line plot to show five individual lines and plot a marker for each year of emissions.

8/21/2020 - Took Off From Coding For Work

8/22/2020 - Finishing Plots Today
09:55 A.M. Logged into class for todays session
10:20 A.M. Installing EDB and PGAdmin today
10:55 A.M. Briefed on everyones progress
12:10 A.M. Lunch and going solo
03:29 P.M. Having trouble with population/state graph. Need to review MatPlotLib y-axis limitations and autosetting. Also need a break... Three hours and zero progress. I didn't have trouble with MatPlot in class so I must be overthinking it.
07:16 P.M. Getting started on a second attempt for the day
09:12 P.M. Finished "Population by State" graph which I know was a total waste of time... but I wanted it...
09:31 P.M. Had to fix the csv's to show state abbreviations so I could merge the emissions data with the population data
09:43 P.M. Emissions data had to be updated to fit the previous edits as well
11:12 P.M. Trying to get my multiplot line to work but I've run into some roadblocks I believe are rooted in my dataframes. I'm going to do some more research and get it figured out. I'll use a chi-test and t-test to determine correlation on my last plot.

8/23/2020 - Reworking Plots To Show Hypothesis Data
07:45 P.M. Home from work 
08:00 P.M. Settled in to start work on combining my graphs to show correlation between population and emissions. I think all 50 states would be more impressive, and doing a box and whiskers or t/chi test would prove a relationship.
08:20 P.M. Finished the 10 year emissions chart for 50 states
10:45 P.M. Spent two hours trying to understand how to fit a grouped chart within the provided limits. Kill me. 
11:31 P.M. Finished formatting my grouped bar graph. It does not prove my point. 
11:44 P.M. Changing direction for my next plots. I am trying to prove my hypothesis, and the five states we chose do not show my data the best. I am not comparing my data to anyone elses in the group, therefore, unique nominators are okay as long as we use the same denomenator for comparing data. 
11:50 P.M. Going to make a five line plot to show the relationship between the five most populous states (CA, TX, FL, NY, IL) and their emissions rates over the past 10 years.

8/24/2020 - Finishing Line and Box/Whiskers Plots
12:27 P.M. Beginning the work day
01:45 P.M. Found an error with my kernal that was preventing my plots from autosizing properly. 
03:00 P.M. Finished line plot for five states and emissions rates
