Explored different open source data that would provide insight into solar usage by state. Identified EIA as having potential. 
Began a jupyter notebook using the https://www.eia.gov/opendata/ resources but needed a new API in addition to the data.gov API
Submitted a request for the API.

Finsiehd API homework while waiting for EIA API. Realized it went to junk mail! :woman_facepalming:
Continue to explore if the data will be sufficient to measure solar usage by state.

Worked to get the API from EIA to work. Identified that first step was to pull the state SEDS series ID in order to 
put the SEDS into the url for the State Production data. Stuck on looping through the SEDS.

**8/18/2020**
Class day. Worked more on the API and was able to get the for loops to output all state SEDS however the output 
is only WY. Not sure why the other states will not fill table. During project work in class Juliet was able to find a CSV with 
State production data. Will stop working on API unless there is time. Will begin working on my portion of analysis.

**8/19/2020**
Build another branch to begin analysis. Will begin importing CSV files into a new jupyter notebook to build visuals and analyze data. 
My portion of the project will be State Solar production vs air quality (CO2 emissions).
