My goals from team insights: 8/13/2020
Tammi: Explore, look at the data. What can you bring back to the team?
Asia: What metrics can be collected from the data to answer our inital questions? Cost, output, impact, etc
Gina: Come from curious. After looking at the data, what questions do you have?

Used emissions API to discover and plot emissions trends over 10 years

Tasked with gathering solar output data by state. Two API's required: Output data is given by station. 
Needed to find station lats and longs by state. Began with Colorado out of randomness. Was able to retrieve
station data and create a list of tuples to feed ouput API. Exceeded rate limit at 3:20. Need wait an hour.
Will try again later to gather state info for CO and then alter parameters for other states. need to rename
notebooks, my bad

Looking at output data, realized that this output data is not what we are looking for.
Saved ipynb for elsewhere in case we need it, but removed it from the repo. Working with data from eia
currently. Pushed a dataframe for renewable energy production by state over the last ten years. Will plot
later. Thought it would be useful when drawing conclusions about solar impact on emissions.
